        <p>Cheese has been enjoyed for many thousands of years, both for food and as a delicacy. Nowadays there are hundreds of types of cheeses from around the world with a multitude of different flavors from sweet to salty and sour. If you couldn't already tell, I rather enjoy cheese. Despite being lactose intolerant myself, cheese is one of, if not, my favorite food. My personal favorite cheese is halloumi. Halloumi is a rather expensive cheese meaning I can only buy it once every two months, so it needs to be savored. Halloumi is typically bought in blocks, floating in its cheese juice, rather than being dried and served in a wheel like some other types of cheese. Halloumi is prepared differently from most common cheeses like camembert, which is served typically on a savory biscuit or cracker if you will. Halloumi is cooked on a frying pan. It is normally sliced into small, thick, rectangles, and fried with oil for several minutes. Halloumi, unlike other cheeses, is salty and has a texture that cannot be described other than it will fall apart in your mouth. Personally, I like to ingest halloumi by itself, rather than with a cracker, it's a wonderful snack food but also serves well as a side with dinner, but I wouldn't recommend doing that for most people for fear of you taking too much salt. Myself however, my blood is a tad bit goofy, so the more salt for me the better, I think, my doctor told me more salt if good for me. To conclude, Halloumi is a soft, salty cheese, typically served by itself, and fried. My personal favorite type of halloumi, is the halloumi pie from A1 bakery, sadly I like in Queensland now, so I haven’t had it for some time as A1 bakery only operates in Victoria and New South Wales. Of course I absolutely love other cheeses, however choosing a second favorite cheese is hard. If I had to choose, which I don't I'm writing this out of boredom in school, camembert would be running for second place in my cheese list. I'm sure you know all about camembert, but did you know that in France, it isn't eaten on a cracker. It's typically eaten on a slice of baguette, and almost never a cracker. It is also eaten by itself, like how I choose it eat it. Camembert is a great dish to have on the side of a meal, as well as the main course of afternoon tea. Camembert is typically made into a small, roughly hand size wheel, with a soft like inside and a hard, white, outer shell. If you have any interest in cheese, I’m sure you would’ve already known this, but for my non cheese connoisseurs reading this, I hope if will have use for this information, at the old people home, cheese quiz. I interrupt your cheese reading by saying, I’ve been writing this for two hours, its 1:54pm, and I’m watching the movie Gallipoli from some time in the 1980’s because I’m Australian, and I need to learn about WWII. I’m not sorry for that but anyway, back to cheese. Camembert is a much more popular cheese than halloumi, and for a lot of people it probably tastes better too. Halloumi predates camembert by several hundreds of years, originating in Cyprus, as opposed to camembert, which comes from Normandy. If you’ve ever tried camembert, and I recommend you do, it is very similar to brie. In fact, camembert is based on top of brie, the recipe originates from Brie, France and made it’s way to Normandy, creating camembert. They are quite similar however they have some large differences. Brie is made in a large wheel having a diameter (size of circle from edge to edge) ranging anywhere from two to three times the size of camembert. Camembert has a stronger and slightly more sour taste as opposed to brie and the texture is also softer than brie. After a quick read of the camembert Wikipedia article, when warmed, camembert becomes creamier while brie maintains its structure. I know I randomly introduced brie into this increasing long chunk of cheese text, but it comes in a close third in my list of favourites due to its similarities to camembert. After all it’s down to personal preference which one you like more, but this is my cheese list and you can’t tell me otherwise. Coming in fourth place is mozzarella. Mozzarella is most commonly eaten on pizza as it works with almost everything and it has that good cheesy pizza stretch to it. Other ways people eat mozzarella is with bocconcini. For those that don’t know, bocconcini is a small, soft, ball of mozzarella, which like mozzarella itself, is soft and white. Bocconcini is eaten in pasta but can also be really good on a skewer with roast lamb, but this is a cheese list, not a roast dinner list. Personally, bocconcini would’ve made fourth place, but since it’s literally just mozzarella, it gets fourth anyway. A fun fact about mozzarella, it can change it’s colour slightly depending on the animal’s diet. Also a fun fact, it’s the next day now, happy first of February. I don’t know if I’ve already mentioned it, but I;m sure you know that Mozzarella originates from the south of Italy, and was first became wide spread from a cookbook named “Bartolomeo Scappi” in 1570. Mozzarella is made from many different types of milk including; cows milk, goats milk, sheep milk and buffaloes milk. Another form of mozzarella is in stick from. Mozzarella sticks are a popular side dish in the western world, or at least where I live. They are made from battered mozzarella however fried cheese sticks originated from twelfth centaury France. Mozzarella sticks are made from coating mozzarella in breadcrumbs and can be baked or fried in oil. Now returning to the list, coming in number 5 is cheddar. Now, where I live, cheddar is referred to as it’s brand name, tasty cheese. Now in my opinion, that name in a bit cheesy… Yeah bad joke I know, but I shop at Woolworths, where cheddar cheese is branded as tasty cheese, and I can’t lie, it’s pretty tasty. If you don’t know what Woolworths is, it’s a supermarket that sells food from beer to every cheese on this list so far. Now back to what you’re here for, the cheese. I’m sure everyone knows what cheddar is, the semi hard, off white cheese, from the english village of cheddar. Now, nobody really knows when cheddar was originally created, but it became popular in the nineteenth century. A quick fun fact for you, cheddar makes up over 50 percent of the Australian cheese market, so when I’m not having anything else on this list, I’m having cheddar. There really isn’t a whole lot to say about cheddar, it’s just a really popular cheese that works well with most things. It’s an all round great cheese that can be enjoyed on anything really. For the Americans, it goes well on a grilled cheese. For me that’s weird to say, I call it a cheese toasty but in reality it’s the same thing, just depends on how you make it whether it be on a grill or a pan. This whole cheddar arc has been written at the end of the school day, I’m meant to be doing free reading because it’s a Thursday afternoon and that’s what we do at that time in english class. But no I’m writing over a thousand words about cheese and hopefully many more words to come. I like cheddar, it’s my go to cheese when I’m not in the mood for anything else and it’s nice to have on a cracker in the morning with a cup of tea. For number six we have feta cheese. This is straying further and further away from a top list of cheeses and more of cheeses I think are cool when I think about what cheese I want to have next in line. Feta is a white, Greek cheese made from sheep’s milk if I remember correctly.
